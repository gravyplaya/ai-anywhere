## 🤝 Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our code of conduct. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/runanywhere-sdks.git
   cd runanywhere-sdks
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment** (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))
4. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

**For Web Development:**
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Environment Setup

1. **Install pre-commit hooks** (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. **Web SDK Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd sdk/runanywhere-web/
   npm install
   ```

## 🔧 Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(web): add streaming support for LLM responses
fix(core): resolve type error in model loading
docs: update README with new API examples
```

## 📤 Submitting Changes

1. **Ensure your code follows our style guidelines** (see [Code Style](#code-style))
2. **Add or update tests** for your changes
3. **Run the test suite** to ensure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   cd sdk/runanywhere-web/
   npm run typecheck
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message
5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature or bug fix per PR
- **Write clear descriptions** - explain what and why, not just how
- **Update documentation** if your changes affect the public API
- **Add tests** for new functionality
- **Ensure CI passes** - all checks must be green

## 🎨 Code Style

### General Guidelines

- **Use meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes
- **Write self-documenting code** with clear intent
- **Add comments** for complex logic or business rules
- **Avoid deep nesting** - prefer early returns and guard clauses
- **Keep functions small** and focused on a single responsibility

### Web (TypeScript)

- Follow standard TypeScript conventions and best practices
- Use consistent formatting enforced by the project's configured linter/formatter
- Prefer strict type safety — avoid `any` where possible
- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` before submitting changes

## 🧪 Testing

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests** for business logic and utilities
- **Integration tests** for API interactions

### Running Tests

```bash
cd sdk/runanywhere-web/
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage, especially for:
- Core SDK functionality
- API interfaces
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

### Before Reporting

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Try the latest version** to see if the issue is already fixed
